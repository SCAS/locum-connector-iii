iiitools_2006.php:

  --in place_hold(), put the following two lines in the following order:
        if ($pickup_loc) { $postvars[] = 'loc=' . $pickup_loc; }
        $post = implode('&', $postvars);
  --add section of code to place_hold() which parses if return is requesting selection of a branch for pickup
  --extended pay_fine() so it accepts either of the following (may need confg setting):
        Your payment has been approved
        Your payment has been accepted

locum_iii_2006.php:

  --removed the first of the following lines from item_status() since the second clobbers it:
        $regex_o = '%bibOrderEntry(.*?)td(.*?)>(.*?)<%U';
        $regex_o = '%bibOrderEntry(.*?)td(.*?)>(.*?)<%s';
